Overview:


BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a deep learning model developed by Google that revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP). Unlike traditional models, BERT understands context bidirectionally, making it highly effective for NLP tasks.

BERT enhances language comprehension by recognizing bidirectional word relationships. It enables machines to process text similarly to humans. Key applications include:
-->Text Classification – Identifying topics or sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).
-->Sentiment Analysis – Determining emotions or opinions in text data.
-->Named Entity Recognition (NER) – Extracting important entities like names, places, and organizations.
-->Question Answering – Understanding questions and retrieving relevant answers.
-->Text Summarization – Generating concise summaries of large text documents.


Installation & Requirements
Ensure the following dependencies are installed before running the project:
pip install transformers torch tensorflow pandas scikit-learn matplotlib


Dataset Description:

The dataset is in CSV format and contains textual data along with corresponding labels. The structure includes:

Text Column – Contains the raw text data for classification.
Label Column – Represents the categorical class, which is converted into a numerical format during preprocessing.


Process Workflow:
-->Load CSV Data – Read the dataset into a dataframe using Pandas for structured access to text and labels.
-->Preprocess and Map Labels – Clean the text by removing special characters, punctuation, and unnecessary spaces. Convert categorical labels into numerical form for training.
-->Tokenize Using BERT – Convert text into numerical tokens using BERT’s tokenizer, ensuring compatibility with deep learning models.
-->Train BERT Model – Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model on the processed dataset to learn meaningful text patterns.
-->Evaluate with Metrics – Measure performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model effectiveness.
-->Generate Predictions – Use the trained model to classify new/unseen text data and validate generalization capability.
-->Save Model – Store the trained model for future use, enabling easy deployment and reusability.
-->Visualize Accuracy and Loss – Plot training and validation accuracy/loss over epochs to detect overfitting or underfitting trends.

How to Run:
-->Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
-->Run the preprocessing script to clean and tokenize the dataset.
-->Execute the training script to fine-tune BERT on the dataset.
-->Evaluate model performance using the provided metrics.
-->Generate predictions using the trained model on new data.


Run the script using:

python train.py


Results & Insights:
-->The model achieves high accuracy in text classification by leveraging BERT’s contextual understanding.
-->Performance is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliability.
-->Visualizing accuracy and loss trends provides insights into optimization and model improvements.


Future Improvements:
