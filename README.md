BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a deep learning model developed by Google that has revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). BERT is a pre-trained transformer model that understands language context in both directions (left and right) rather than just sequentially, making it one of the most effective models for NLP tasks.

BERT is designed to improve the understanding of the meaning and context of words in a sentence by learning bidirectional relationships. It enables machines to comprehend text similarly to how humans do. Some key applications of BERT include:

Text Classification: Identifying topics or sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral)
Sentiment Analysis: Determining emotions or opinions in text data
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Extracting important entities like names, places, and organizations
Question Answering: Understanding questions and retrieving relevant answers
Text Summarization: Generating concise summaries of large text documents
