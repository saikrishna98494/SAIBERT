BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a deep learning model developed by Google that has revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). BERT is a pre-trained transformer model that understands language context in both directions (left and right) rather than just sequentially, making it one of the most effective models for NLP tasks.

BERT is designed to improve the understanding of the meaning and context of words in a sentence by learning bidirectional relationships. It enables machines to comprehend text similarly to how humans do. Some key applications of BERT include:

-->Text Classification: Identifying topics or sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral)

-->Sentiment Analysis: Determining emotions or opinions in text data

-->Named Entity Recognition (NER): Extracting important entities like names, places, and organizations

-->Question Answering: Understanding questions and retrieving relevant answers

-->Text Summarization: Generating concise summaries of large text documents


PROCESS: 

Load CSV Data – Read the dataset into a dataframe using a suitable library. This ensures structured access to text and label information.

Preprocess and Map Labels – Clean the text by removing special characters, punctuation, and unnecessary spaces. Convert categorical labels into numerical form for model training.

Tokenize Using BERT – Utilize BERT’s tokenizer to convert text into numerical tokens. This prepares the data in a format suitable for deep learning models.

Train BERT Model – Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model on the processed dataset. The model learns to recognize patterns in text and associate them with specific labels.

Evaluate with Metrics – Measure the model’s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This helps assess the reliability and effectiveness of the classification.

Generate Predictions – Use the trained model to classify new or unseen text data. This step verifies the model’s ability to generalize its learning beyond training data.

Save Model – Store the trained model for future use, ensuring it can be reloaded without retraining. This allows easy deployment and further refinement if needed.

Visualize Accuracy and Loss – Plot the training and validation accuracy/loss over epochs. This helps analyze model performance and detect overfitting or underfitting trends.
